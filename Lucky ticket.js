//In Russia regular bus tickets usually consist of 6 digits. 
//The ticket is called lucky when the sum of the first three 
//digits equals to the sum of the last three digits. Write a 
//function to find out whether the ticket is lucky or not. 
//Return true if so, otherwise return false. Consider that 
//input is always a string.

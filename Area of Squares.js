//Theater Square has a rectangular shape of size n × m meters. 
//Not long ago the the City Council decided to pave the Square 
//with square granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size a × a.
//What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square? 
//It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square, 
//but the Square has to be covered. It's not allowed to break the 
//flagstones. The sides of flagstones should be parallel to the sides 
//of the Square.
